## About the app

Managing information is hard. Trying to schedule and maintain a learning pace is near impossible unless you really focus down or get somebody else to deal with all of the planning for you. There is a lot of manual steps involved, like prioritizing the knowledge, scheduling when to learn, review, etc. This is all stuff that can be done by a computer much faster and more efficiently.

SliceR is a specialized browser with first class support forÂ [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning).

### Name

SliceR allows you to import websites (articles) and videos. Then it will enable you to split them into smaller pieces and track your progress. This way you can read a big website over time instead of getting overwhelmed. Slicer is cutting information down so you can consume it. Just like a pizza slice.

### Purpose

There is a wealth of information out there that your are never going to consume or gain knowledge from. All those files, videos, bookmarks, screenshots will be forgotten. You wonâ€™t become a master.

SliceR is your teacher. The one tool that will keep you accountable to your learning goals. It will help you stay on track and be true to your goals. SliceR makes learning funÂ ðŸ¤©Â Achieve mastery!

### Goal

The goal is to help people learn fast and remember things for life. Whether that is from a YouTube video or a website filled with lots of information.

### User target

Professionals that need to constantly learn new things like engineers, doctors, business owners, managers and autodidacts. Also people who are struggling with learning constantly from their reading material or people who are overvhwelmed by their YouTube watch later playlist filled with lots of useful videos they will never watch.

### Competitors

Please note that this space is still so young so the competition is not great. Most of them are only implemented parts of incremental reading, mainly the spaced repetition part. All of the solutions out there are really crappy (IMHO). Thatâ€™s why I want to build a better far superior solution for incremental reading.
